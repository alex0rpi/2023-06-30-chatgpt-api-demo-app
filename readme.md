This is a simple node app that displays a chat on the terminal with a chatgpt based bot.

Please create a .env file and fill it with the fields specified in .env-test.
Make sure not to share your openai api key.

To this day, seems one needs a payed account to have this api work. Otherwise a 429 error is thrown.
